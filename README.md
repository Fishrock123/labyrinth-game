# Labyrinth Brewery - THE GAME

A few of my buds at my local brewery are making a beer of my own specification, so I decided to make them a video game. One of the main reasons I'm doing this is to learn
https://www.rust-lang.org/. 

This project is possible because of https://bevyengine.org/, a ECS and rendering engine that's brand new, and super sweet.

The game will be a market similuation / roguelike hybrid. You, the Hero, will decend into the dungeon below Labyrinth Brewery in order to gather materials for your next
craft beer or cider recipe. If you parish during the depths you will find yourself on the Bar Room floor, with all of your recipes and improvements but all of your
items will be gone!

Solving the mystery of the Labynrith Below Labyrinth.

Currently, this codebase is merely being used to design the basic systems and datatypes needed for the game. It is going to leverage the rust scripting engine RHAI for NPC / Powers / AI development.

## Design Goals 

- Create a character for every Regular and Employee of Labyrinth
- Celler Trolls, Beer Wizards, Cantankerous owners oh my.
- Sprites designed by Hadria Beth (https://hadriabeth.com)

## TODO

- So much stuff...
